Welcome to nanoaod-base-analysis's documentation!
=================================================

This code aims to process NanoAOD datasets, allowing to generate different root files, histograms and plots with the desired selection of events, variables and branches. 

It's a Python and RDataFrame based framework that uses `law <https://github.com/riga/law>`_ to perform multiple CMS analyses.

Therefore, it is only required to create a configuration with specific settings of your analysis to start using the code with law commands.
